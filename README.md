# Gram

Gram is a python web application that has been made with Django. It is meant to be a clone of the popular application Instagram.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Users are first required to sign in to in order to use the application. The registration is carried out using Django registation that eliminates the possibility of having bugs. The user can then use the navbar to scroll through the various page in the application as well as logging out.

## Bugs
  Users are able to see pictures that have been posted by other users on their profile.

## Future Improvements
 
  Some functions of Instagram such as followings other users and seeing user stories would be a nice addition to the application.
